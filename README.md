# PicoCalc Terminal

A standalone SSH client and VT100/ANSI terminal emulator for the [Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/) running on the [ClockworkPi PicoCalc](https://www.clockworkpi.com/picocalc).

This project transforms your PicoCalc into a pocket-sized, WiFi-enabled terminal capable of connecting to remote servers via SSH.

## Features

*   **Standalone SSH Client**: Connect to any SSH server directly from the device.
*   **Robust Terminal Emulation**: Built on the `vte` crate for accurate ANSI/VT100 parsing.
*   **Extended Character Support**: Custom rendering for box-drawing characters (lines, corners, shades) for TUI applications like `htop`, `mc`, and `tmux`.
*   **Local Shell**: Built-in commands for device management (WiFi config, battery status, backlight control).
*   **Hardware Accelerated**: Uses the RP2350's capabilities and the ILI9488 display for fast rendering.

## Hardware Requirements

*   **ClockworkPi PicoCalc**
*   **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** (RP2350 with WiFi)
    *   *Note: This firmware is specifically designed for the RP2350 architecture.*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a standard Rust toolchain and a few helper tools:

1.  **Install Rust**: [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
2.  **Install the Nightly Toolchain**:
    ```bash
    rustup toolchain install nightly
    ```
3.  **Add the Compilation Target**:
    ```bash
    rustup target add thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf
    ```
4.  **Install Helper Tools**:
    ```bash
    cargo install flip-link
    # Install picotool (follow instructions at https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool)
    ```

### Building & Flashing

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/richcannings/picocalc-wezterm.git
    cd picocalc-wezterm
    ```

2.  **Build the Firmware**:
    ```bash
    # For Pimoroni Pico Plus 2 W (standard PicoCalc upgrade)
    cargo +nightly build --release --features pimoroni2w
    ```

3.  **Generate UF2 File**:
    ```bash
    # Convert the ELF to UF2
    cp target/thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf/release/picocalc-wezterm target/thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf/release/picocalc-wezterm.elf
    picotool uf2 convert target/thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf/release/picocalc-wezterm.elf picocalc.uf2
    ```

4.  **Flash**:
    *   Hold the BOOTSEL button on your Pico 2 W while plugging it in.
    *   Copy `picocalc.uf2` to the mounted `RPI-RP2` drive.

## Usage

### Initial Setup (WiFi)

On first boot, you need to configure your WiFi credentials. The device includes a local shell for configuration.

```bash
# Format the config storage (only needed once)
$ config format

# Set WiFi credentials
$ config set wifi_ssid MyNetwork
$ config set wifi_pw MyPassword

# Reboot to apply
$ reboot
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Credentials are stored in clear-text in the device's flash memory.

### Connecting via SSH

Once connected to WiFi (you'll see an IP address), you can connect to a remote host:

```bash
$ ssh user@192.168.1.10
# or
$ ssh 192.168.1.10
```

You can also save credentials to avoid typing them every time:

```bash
$ config set ssh_user myuser
$ config set ssh_pw mypassword
```

### Local Commands

*   `cls`: Clear the screen.
*   `bat`: Show battery status.
*   `bl lcd <percent>`: Set LCD backlight brightness (e.g., `bl lcd 50`).
*   `bl kbd <percent>`: Set keyboard backlight brightness (requires updated keyboard firmware).
*   `free`: Show memory usage.
*   `bootsel`: Reboot into bootloader mode.
